:figure-number: 127

This section presents how TITAN Designer plugin implement the Call Hierarchy View.

During the development is often useful to get a higher level view of a TTCN-3 function's (image:images/function.png[title="function_icon"]), testcase's (image:images/testcase.png[title="testcase_icon"]) or external function's (image:images/function_external.png[title="function_external_icon"]) call hierarchies. This view help you see your function's place in the call tree and you can see witch other functions call your's.

You can call the view from the show view menu, from the right click menu or with the CTRL+ALT+H command.
The Call Hierarchy View consists of three main parts. The toolbar, the actual tree view and the current call list.

== The Tree

The root of the tree always represents the searched TTCN-3 function (image:images/function.png[title="functionicon"]), testcase (image:images/testcase.png[title="testcase_icon"]) or external function (image:images/function_external.png[title="function_external_icon"]). The second level of the tree contains the functions what call the searched (root) function. Near the tree nodes you can see the calls number. When you click to a tree node, the editor jump to the function definition and select it automatically (if this option is enabled image:images/11_12_call_hierarchy_view_definition_jump_icon.png[title="definition_jump_icon"] ) and the call list on the right side show the current calls, if the call list is enabled (image:images/11_14_call_hierarchy_view_call_list_icon.png[title="call_list_icon"]). When you click to the small arrow near a subnode  (image:images/11_10_call_hierarchy_view_tree_node.png[title="tree_node"]), you start a subsearch on the selected node. You can build recursively the part of the tree what you need.

== The Call List

Near the tree nodes you can see the calls number (image:images/11_10_call_hierarchy_view_tree_node.png[title="tree_node"]), when you click to a tree node the call list show the calls with the row number. When you click to a row in the list, the editor jump to the call's row. (image:images/11_11_call_hierarchy_view_call_list_row.png[title="view_call_list_row"]) You can switch off the call list in the toolbar. (image:images/11_14_call_hierarchy_view_call_list_icon.png[title="call_list_icon"])

== The Toolbar

On the top of the view you can see a toolbar vith five button:
