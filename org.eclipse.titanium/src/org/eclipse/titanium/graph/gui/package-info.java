/**
 * <p>
 * <code>org.eclipse.titan.graph.gui</code> package contains the pure gui
 * classes inside. All the items shown on the user interface are implemented
 * here. The package contains the graph drawing area's implementation, the
 * implementation of the poping up window for metrics datas, two special classes
 * that are special Swing menu items, in order to store additional informations
 * inside menu items (these are only needed from the programming interface, they
 * are not shown on the user interface), and finally a useful class which
 * implements a simple and safe method to show Eclipse error messages (usually
 * caught exceptions are shown in this window).
