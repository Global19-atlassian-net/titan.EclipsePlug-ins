 * The common interface of all metrics.

 * Metrics are stateless classes, that can provide information about a TTCN3

 * <li>Create a {@link MetricData} object on a TTCN3 project</li>
 * <li>query the result of the metrics.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Metrics store any information collected during the measurement in the
 * <code>MetricData</code> objects.
