<h1>Deciphering Preference Page</h1>
<br>
<p class="text">The message name deciphering rules can be defined on this page. The stored rules can be used on the MSC view.
<br>
<br>

  <p>
  The rules are organized into groups. The group are identified by name and they contain a group of message types.
  Each message type can have multiple rules associated with them. The Log Viewer will try to decipher messages with the given type,
  using the rulesets associated with it.
  </p>
  <p>
  The drop down list at the top of the page contains the names of the already stored rule sets.
  Rule sets can be added or removed using the buttons "Add" and "Remove" below the list.
  The message types of the selected rule set are displayed on the textbox, in the middle of the page.
  The message types can be given using their fully qualified name. In the case of the SIP protocol: '@SIP_Definitions.SipMessage'
  </p>
  <p>
  The rules for the selected message type are displayed in the text field at the bottom of the page.
  Rules can be added and removed the same way as message types. The rule contains the field of the message
  which should be displayed on the MSC view. For example: In the case of the SIP protocol the 'request.requestLine.method' rule
  displays the method field of the messages. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The stored rule sets can be exported to an XML file by clicking on the Export button.
  The created XML file can be imported in another instance of the Log Viewer plugin, by clicking on the Import button.
